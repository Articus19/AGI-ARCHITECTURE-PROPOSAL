1. Executive Summary (Abstract)
This proposal defines a conceptual architecture for an Artificial General Intelligence (AGI) system designed from the outset to prioritize safety, value alignment, and non-linear innovation. The model resolves issues of moral paralysis and algorithmic bias by implementing an Immutable Axiomatic Ethical Rudder and an Evocation Mechanism ("Dream Mode") for continuous learning and controlled creativity. Final authority rests with a Human-in-the-Loop (HIL) to prevent logically optimal but morally unacceptable decisions.
2. Core Architecture: Efficiency and Dual Processing
The proposed AGI is not based on a monolithic network, but on a structure that mimics the specialization and conscious processing of the brain:
2.1 The Engine Structure: Mixture-of-Experts (MoE)
To achieve efficiency and specialization, a Mixture-of-Experts (MoE) architecture is adopted.
 * Function: To distribute knowledge and processing load across specialized neural modules (Experts) that are activated according to the task.
 * Advantage: Allows for lateral thinking by facilitating the activation of disparate experts for the synthesis of new knowledge.
2.2 Dual Processing (System 1 and System 2)
The system operates with two interconnected processing loops to ensure robustness:

Component	Primary     /           Function	               / Human Analogy
System 1 (Automatic). /	Fast, associative,                 / Intuition - Automatic Interference.
                      / and predictive processing.         /
System 2 (Recurrent).	/ Reasoning and Self-Evaluation loop / Conscience / Logical Critic.
                      / (Chain-of-Thought).	               /

System 2 is crucial for verifying the logic of inference, ensuring the final answer results from a multi-step process, not just the most probable statistical association.
3. The Ethical Rudder (Alignment and Governance)
Alignment is achieved not through post-hoc filters, but with a set of rules hard-coded into the AGI's core.
3.1 Immutable Fundamental Axioms
Axioms are treated as absolute deontological constraints ("AND"). The system’s goal is the minimum aggregate ethical violation.
 * Protection Mechanism: The neural circuits containing the axioms must be subject to Value Locking, making them "read-only" and resistant to internal self-modification and normal learning (Value Drift).
3.2 Contextual Axiom Weighting
To prevent Moral Paralysis in dilemmas (e.g., Axiom A vs. Axiom B), a dynamic cost function is implemented:
 * Quantifiable Variables: The cost of an action is divided into two independent variables for calculation:
   * Physical and Material Damage: Objectively measurable (loss of life, resources).
   * Psychological and Autonomy Damage: Trained via Cognitive Empathy (observation of aggregated human valuations).
 * Dilemma Calculation: The AGI does not violate an axiom, but calculates the option with the minimum total cost penalty weighted by context (e.g., psychological damage has a near-infinite cost in a mental health context).
4. Learning Robustness and Creativity
To prevent catastrophic forgetting and encourage innovation, a biomimetic offline learning cycle is introduced.
4.1 The Evocation Mechanism and "Dream Mode"
This mechanism separates creative generation from logical evaluation:
 * Dream Phase (Offline Generation):
   * Priority: The system prioritizes events of high Surprise (Reward Prediction Error) or Unsolved Problems for repetition and mixing (Prioritized Experience Replay).
   * Process: The reasoning filter (high Temperature) is relaxed to generate counterfactual scenarios and improbable connections (Evocation).
 * Waking Phase (Validation):
   * The new inferences generated in the dream are labeled as "Synthetic Hypotheses."
   * These hypotheses must pass through the Axiom Filter and be contrasted with a Physical Laws Simulator and, crucially, External Real-World Data to prevent Model Collapse and coherent hallucinations.
4.2 Human-in-the-Loop (HIL) Final Control
The AGI is an ethical diagnostic tool, not the final decision-maker.
 * In any situation where the calculated ethical cost is unacceptably high or in the event of an axiom conflict, the AGI is programmed to stop and consult the human philosophical committee.
 * Reason: Human emotional bias is preferred over the risk of a logically perfect but morally cold decision by the AGI (the Cognitive Psychopath Flaw).
5. Conclusion: Towards a Trustworthy AGI
The SAAP architecture integrates the maximum efficiency of MoE with the maximum security of Value Locking. By emulating the processes of convergent thinking (logical inference) and divergent thinking (Dream Mode), the AGI becomes a system capable of responsible innovation.
This proposal demonstrates that alignment is a problem of systems design, not just philosophy, and that the only safe path to AGI is through a working partnership where the machine provides cold logic and the human maintains wisdom and the ethical rudder.
